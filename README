Clone my repo from the command line: gh clone brentnotmichael/python 
                                 or: git clone https://github.com/brentnotmichael/python

This is where I keep my Python experiments as I expand on the learning I did at City College of San Francisco.

Projects from "Think Python: How to Think Like a Computer Scientist" by Allen B. Downey are in the "thinkpython" folder.
